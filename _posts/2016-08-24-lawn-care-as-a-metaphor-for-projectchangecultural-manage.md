# Lawn Care as a Metaphor for (Project/Change/Cultural) Management

* Don't feed the grass, condition the soil so the soil feeds the grass
* Zen experience of simple monotonous excercise
* change takes time, patience, vigilance
* Don't hack away
* Don't use poisons
* Align the conditions to create the environment that returns the best results
* Measure, take samples, gather data, make educated decisions
* plugs for change
* reseed for change
* right grass type in the right location to get the right growth
* too much sun, too much exposure, wither and die
* Otherwise all the maintenance will be wasted in the long term, too much work, money, and frustration
* "When the root is deep, there is no reason to fear the wind."
* Water deeply and regularly, instead of frequently and superficially
* Walk barefoot and enjoy the fruits of your labor
* Sit back and see the joy of your efforts
